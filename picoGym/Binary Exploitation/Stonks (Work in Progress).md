# Stonks

# Overview
Category: Binary Exploitation

Points: 20

Competition: picoCTF 2021

# Description
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c `nc mercury.picoctf.net 16439`

# Solution
This challenge provides one file: `vuln.c`.

In the C file, this section of code could be vulnerable because of `printf(user_buf)`
