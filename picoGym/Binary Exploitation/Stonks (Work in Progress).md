# Stonks

# Overview
Category: Binary Exploitation

Points: 20

Competition: picoCTF 2021

# Description
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c `nc mercury.picoctf.net 16439`

# Solution
This challenge provides one file: `vuln.c`.

When the `buy_stonks` function is called, it gets the flag from an `api` file in the server, then stores it in char array `api_buf`, so the flag is stored in memory.

`malloc` is used to allocate memory of a specific size, in this case, 301 bytes, then the memory address of this allocated block of memory is stored in the `user_buf` char pointer.
