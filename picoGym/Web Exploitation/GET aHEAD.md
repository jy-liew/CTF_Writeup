The page turns blue when "Choose Blue" is clicked, and the page turns red when "Choose Red" is clicked.

While checking the network section of inspect, I can see both methods of `index.php` and `favicon.ico` are "GET" when "Red" is selected.

Changing the method of "index.php" to "HEAD" reveals the flag.
